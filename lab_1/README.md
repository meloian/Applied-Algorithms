# Set based on Ordered list 

All items are stored in order. When you add an item, it goes to the next available spot. You can also delete and search for items using a linear list.

The code is divided into several files to make it more structured: operations with set (`set_operations.py`), time measurement (`timing_utils.py`), visualization of experimental results (`plot_utils.py`), and the main program flow (`main.py`).
